## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal
   - TF-IDF vectorization

2. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes
   - Train-test split
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

3. **Visualization**
   - Word clouds, bar plots of frequent words, confusion matrix
