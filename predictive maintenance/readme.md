## 🔍 Problem Statement

Unplanned equipment failures can be costly and disruptive. The aim is to build a model that can analyze sensor data to predict whether a machine will fail, enabling timely maintenance.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution of sensor readings
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Failure trend analysis

3. **Modeling**
   - Train-test split
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest
   - Model evaluation with classification report and ROC-AUC

---

## 📈 Results

The final model demonstrated strong performance in identifying potential failures with high precision and recall. This kind of model can be directly applied in production systems to trigger maintenance alerts.
